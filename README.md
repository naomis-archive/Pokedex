# Pokedex

This page uses the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to search for a Pokemon by name or number. The page was started by following along with a [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/), with additional functionality written by myself.
